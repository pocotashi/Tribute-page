    <h3 id="headline">Here are nine astonishing ways David Attenborough shaped your world</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1954: Wildlife for the massess</strong> - He joined the BBC as a trainee in 1952, having only ever watched one television programme. His hit series 'Zoo Quest' combined live studio presentation with footage shot in location for the first time.It brough rare animals into viewers' living rooms and proved wildlife programmes could attract big audiences.</li>
      <li> <strong>1965: Civilisation in colour!</strong> - As Controller of BBC Two, he oversaw the first ever-colour broadcasts in Europe. Those landmark series helped inaugurate a new king of televison documentary, putting history, ciulture and science on screen in ways never seen before.</li>
      <li><strong>1969: Month Python's Flying Circus</strong> - By now BBC Director of Programmes, Attenborough continued to innovate and reinvent television - but this time in the world of comedy.</li>
      <li><strong>1975: Back to nature</strong> - Freed from his role as a BBC executive, Attenborough went back to nature to become an explorer. He made a series of programmes about tribes. He immersed himself in their cultures, wearing nothing but a loin cloth while filming in the Solomon Islands.</li>
      <li><strong>1979: Inventing epics</strong> - Taking inspiration from series like Civilisation he travelled the globe to deliver his definitive take on the wonders of the natural world. The result was Life on Earth, a televisual feast which used stunning photography and innovative camera techniques to show animals in their natural habitat. </li>
      <li><strong>1994: A rose by any other name...</strong> - While filming The Private Life of Plants, Sir David noticed the world's largest flowering plant had quite a racy name - the Amorphophallus Titanum. Instead, he gave it another name in his script - titum arum - coining the plant's common name in the process. But as well as naming species, many plants and animals have bneen named after Sir David. </li>
      <li><strong>2001: Your first glimpse</strong> - Without the ambition and persistance of Attenborough and his collaboratos, millions of us may never have seen some of the world's rarest creatures. In 2001, we were given an insight into a strange new world, when Attenborough narrated The Blue Planet. The series introduced millions to the wonders of the deep sea and was the first time some species were captured on film.</li>
      <li><strong>2015: Pushing boundaries</strong> - In 2015, he dived 1,000ft in a submersible off the Australian coast to film previously unseen parts of the Great Barrier Reef, breaking the record for the deepest ever dive on the reef. </li>
      <li><strong>2015: Saving the world</strong> - He's authored documentaries which overtly tackle environmental issues but prefers a subtler approach, showcasing the natural world in the hope we might be inspired to preserve it. He also met with President Obama in 2015 to discuss the challenge of tackling climate change.</li>
